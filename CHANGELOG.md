  - [rust-lightning](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning) was updated to [v0.0.113](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.113) in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655)
  - Channel `current_confirmations` and `required_confirmations` were added to channel details RPCs in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655)

    - When electrums were down, if a channel was closed, the channel closing transaction wasn't broadcasted. A check for a network error to rebroadcast the tx after a delay was added.
    - If an invoice payment failed, retring paying the same invoice would cause the payment to not be updated to successful in the DB even if it were successful. A method to update the payment in the DB was added to fix this.
